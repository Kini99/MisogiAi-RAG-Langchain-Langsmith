from langchain_community.llms import Ollama

llm = Ollama(model="llama3.1:8b")
```

### 2. Self-Hosted Vector Databases
**ChromaDB Implementation:**
```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma

# Persistent storage with no hosting fees
vector_store = Chroma(
    persist_directory="./chroma_db",
    embedding_function=embeddings
)
```

**Cost Benefits:**
- **Zero hosting fees**: $0/month
- **Full control**: Custom configurations
- **Data privacy**: No external dependencies

### 3. Batch Processing Strategy
**Document Processing Pipeline:**
```python
# Process documents offline to reduce real-time costs
def batch_process_documents(directory):
    documents = load_documents(directory)
    embeddings = generate_embeddings_batch(documents)
    store_in_vector_db(embeddings)
```

**Cost Optimization:**
- **Reduced API calls**: Process once, query many times
- **Scheduled processing**: Use off-peak compute resources
- **Incremental updates**: Only process new/changed documents

### 4. Embedding Caching
**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
import hashlib
import pickle

class EmbeddingCache:
    def __init__(self, cache_file="embeddings_cache.pkl"):
        self.cache_file = cache_file
        self.cache = self.load_cache()
    
    def get_embedding(self, text):
        text_hash = hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
        if text_hash in self.cache:
            return self.cache[text_hash]
        
        embedding = self.generate_embedding(text)
        self.cache[text_hash] = embedding
        self.save_cache()
        return embedding
```

**Cost Savings:**
- **Avoid recomputation**: 60-80% reduction in embedding costs
- **Faster responses**: Cached embeddings load instantly
- **Reduced API calls**: Significant savings for repeated content

### 5. Tiered LLM Strategy
**Implementation:**
```python
class TieredLLMStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.simple_llm = Ollama(model="phi3:mini")  # Cheap, fast
        self.complex_llm = Ollama(model="llama3.1:8b")  # Expensive, accurate
    
    def route_query(self, query, complexity_score):
        if complexity_score < 0.3:
            return self.simple_llm
        else:
            return self.complex_llm
```

**Cost Benefits:**
- **Simple queries**: Use lightweight models (90% cost reduction)
- **Complex queries**: Use powerful models only when needed
- **Intelligent routing**: 40-60% overall cost reduction
